---

## Phase 6: Native Modules & Bridging (Advanced, 3–5 weeks)

- [ ] Image optimization and caching (`react-native-fast-image`)
- [ ] Reducing bundle size
- [ ] Hermes engine understanding
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Native performance profiling (Flipper, Xcode Instruments, Android Profiler)
- [ ] Reanimated for smooth animations (v3+)
- [ ] Gesture Handler for native-feeling gestures

---

## Phase 9: App Architecture & Best Practices (3–4 weeks)

- [ ] Project folder structure & feature-based architecture
- [ ] Design patterns (container/presenter, custom hooks pattern)
- [ ] Environment configuration (`.env` files, multiple environments — dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Code quality: ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Monorepo tools (Turborepo, Nx) — for larger teams
- [ ] Accessibility (a11y) best practices
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n)
